## How to use

### Fonts

I use 4 font variables. Change them to your own styles in `app/layer.tsx`.

- `font-logo` for the website's logo.
- `font-display` for the landing page headline.
- `font-sans` for the website's body.
- `font-mono` for code blocks.

### Content

Replace my content under the `/content` directory with yours. This includes:

- Navigation items.
- Social links.
- Projects.
- Education & Experience.

### Blog Posts

I use contentlayer alongside mdx. Delete the files under `/posts`, and add your own.

### Syntax Highlighting

I made a custom cod block component `/components/code-block.tsx` using shiki. Change your
light & dark themes there.
